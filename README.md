## Tech Stack

### Client

The client is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the build tool. It uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling, [Tanstack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/) for routing.

It uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for formatting.

### Server

The server is built in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). It uses [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws) for WebSocket communication.

## Setup

Ensure both [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) are installed.

### Client

```bash
cd client
pnpm install
```

### Server

```bash
cd server
pnpm install
```

## Usage

### Development

For both client and server, run the following command in their respective directories:

```bash
